# Face Mask Detection using Convolution Neural Network
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect whether individuals are wearing face masks. The system processes images and classifies them into two categories: With Mask and Without Mask.

## Overview
Face mask detection has become crucial in public health measures during pandemics. This project provides a robust solution to automate face mask detection using deep learning techniques. It is built using Python and popular libraries like TensorFlow/Keras, ensuring high performance and accuracy.

## Requirements
