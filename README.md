# Face Mask Detection using CNN
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect whether individuals are wearing face masks. The system processes images and classifies them into two categories: With Mask and Without Mask.

## Features
- High-accuracy face mask detection using CNN.
- Efficient data preprocessing and augmentation for model training.
- Integration with Python libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-mask-detection.git
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Run the notebook or scripts for training and detection.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x,
- TensorFlow/Keras,
- NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, Matplotlib

## Usage
Training: Use the provided notebook or script to train the CNN model.
Detection: Apply the trained model to classify images or video streams.
